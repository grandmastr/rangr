# Rangr Browser Extension

Rangr is a dynamic browser extension designed to facilitate effortless API testing right from your browser. Initially, Rangr offers a sleek, user-friendly interface for crafting, sending HTTP requests, and viewing responses, akin to a Postman-like experience. As Rangr evolves, it will introduce a robust service to intercept and reroute network requests to a local mock server, enabling offline development and network condition simulation.

## Features

- **Send HTTP Requests**: Easily send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to test your APIs.
- **View Responses**: Display responses in a formatted, readable manner.
- **Save Requests**: Save frequently used requests for quicker access in the future.
- **Organize Requests**: Group your requests in collections for better organization and sharing with team members.
- **Performance Analytics**: Analyze the performance of your requests with built-in analytics.

## Upcoming Features

- **Intercept and Reroute Requests**: Intercept network requests from the active tab and reroute them to a local mock server for offline development and testing.
- **Mock Data Management**: Define, import, and export mock data for rerouted requests.
- **Network Condition Simulation**: Simulate different network conditions to ensure app robustness.
- **Local Mock Server**: Bundled local mock server for hosting and managing mock data.
